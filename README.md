# roccat_kone_aimo
A few bits of code to set RGB leds on a Rocca Kone Aimo mouse.

Meant for linux, the python scripts might work on windows.

The cpp tool is recommended, it's fast enough to be used in scripts for nice animations.
The cpp tool only works with the hidraw driver.
Or just to disable the leds (Set all to 0).

The python script works, but cannot used to animate leds under linux.
